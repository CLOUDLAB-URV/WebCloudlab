            <p>P2PGRID project is focused on the design of innovative large scale distributed systems, decentralized, able to adapt to complex environments – in terms of infrastructure or use- and heterogeneous in the access to communication and computation resources.</p>

            <p>A key goal is the use of economic algorithms in order to create a Grid infrastructure with efficient resource allocation mechanisms. It is thus necessary the study, design, and evaluation of resource allocation algorithms in distributed computation systems. Such systems must take into account several variables --like client demand, resource state and availability, and the competition among services—to provide decentralized and autonomous system adaptivity.</p>
              
            <p>Another important objective is the creation of a peer-to-peer middleware infrastructure providing advanced services as indirection, resource location, content distribution and access, and efficient communication channels for scalable group communication. We will also design novel programming abstractions for constructing fault-tolerant wide-area applications on top of the infrastructure. We outline three main research challenges: the design of adaptive and sel3f-adjusting mechanisms for heterogeneous resources and environments, the convergence of Web, P2P and Grid systems, and the future support for millions of mobile devices (local/global access).</p>
              
            <p>P2PGRID merges researchers in the Grid and peer-to-peer settings in order to achieve constructive synergies between efficient resource assignment algorithms and scalable routing and data distribution techniques available in both approaches. The unifying e-services frame enables the construction of generic infrastructures capable of solving problems in contexts of applications adapted to context/ambient, collaborative work or distributed wide-area services.</p>
