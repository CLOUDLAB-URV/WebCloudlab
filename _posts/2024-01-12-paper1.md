We are glad to announce that our research paper, "Exploiting Inherent Elasticity of Serverless in Algorithms with Unbalanced and Irregular Workloads", has been accepted and published in the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing. 

In this article, we showcase the capability of serverless computing to provide exceptional cost-performance benefits for unbalanced algorithms on a large scale. We also introduce a novel approach that combines local and remote computing entities, preserving the simplicity of original algorithms. 

We are excited about the potential impact of our work and look forward to continuing our research in this area.
